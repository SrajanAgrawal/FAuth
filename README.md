## 💫Challenges Faced And Learnings
### As Because I was not experienced well enough for creating this kind of projects🤔, So I found Many Difficulties in just doing that stuff(which can be very easy for others😎). But I tried to give my best✨
### At the very first when I started exploring all the projects. I realized that with my currnet knowledge it is not possible to complete it, So I search about the relevant tech stack( Software engineering is a funny field. You work hard to solve a problem correctly, efficiently and elegantly. And once you do that you are no longer required). Then I started learning Django(A Web frameWork of python) and Completed my project using django and some API.
